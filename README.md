# Data-Analysis

I have analyzed the data that I have obtained from experiment and examined the probability of the frequency of variants in learners' output.
I used mixed-logistic regression model with a backward comparison to examine the effect of variants in the output.
The graphs were created using matplotlib and Seaborn

This coding has been co-written with my supervisor James White.
