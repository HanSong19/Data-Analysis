# Data-Analysis

This is a part of my PhD research project. I collected data in a series of experiments at labs in the UK and South Korea. I analysed how often participants chose to use prefix form and how well they applied a phonological alternation to stems. I used a mixed-logistic regression model with a backward comparison.

My supervisor James White wrote the code, and I modified it to fit the Korean dataset.
