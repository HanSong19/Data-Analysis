# Data-Analysis

This is a part of my PhD research project.
I collected data in a series of experiments at labs in the UK and South Korea.
I analysed how often participants chose to use prefix form and how well they applied a phonological alternation to stems.
I used mixed-logistic regression model with a backward comparison.

The code has been written with my supervisor James White and I have modified it to fit to the Korean dataset.
